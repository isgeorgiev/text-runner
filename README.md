# Text-Runner
Bachelor Project - Text-Runner Reimplementation

The main goal of the project is to reimplement the Open Information Extraction(OIE) system called TextRunner. 

It main feature is to extract relations out of a unknown text based on previously observed documents.
The way to do this is to use dependancy parser, which will evaluate every word in the text and associate it with how much it depends uppon the others.
Afterwards, a classifier will go through this evaluation and classify every relation.
At the end ....

Future work would be to implement different language support, in order to make the system multilingual. Tests and results would be presented.
